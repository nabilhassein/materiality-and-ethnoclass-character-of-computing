# The materiality and ethnoclass character of computing
SFPC Detroit
Monday August 19th

## Description
The "virtual" or "digital" is often rhetorically opposed to the "real" or "physical" in a way that works to obscure the materiality of computer technology. In fact, computers are composed of metals and other raw materials extracted from the Earth predominantly by heavily exploited miners in the Global South, particularly Africa, before those same materials are transported for assembly by similarly exploited, predominantly Asian female factory workers into the electronics mostly consumed by the global middle and upper classes. These devices account for a large and growing share of global energy usage -- predicted to outstrip that of aviation or shipping within two years -- and the majority of these high-tech products are designed to last for only a short span of years before becoming waste, with enormous ecological implications. And even as smartphones and other computing devices are becoming available to broader masses especially in the Global South, the US and other imperialist powers still retain substantial control over critical computing infrastructure, from the physical cables that carry worldwide internet traffic, to the software running on all of these machines.

In stark contrast to other highly problematic global structures such as the food system, there is no pre-capitalist or pre-imperialist model of computing to be reclaimed or recovered, due simply to the young age of the entire field. What does this mean for our imaginary of computing's possible futures? How do you personally relate to the uneven ecological impacts and the racialized and gendered division of labor in the global computing industry? How have we observed some of these same patterns on a more intimate scale in our own lives and work? What liberatory potential have we experienced computers being used for, or can we imagine them being used for?
