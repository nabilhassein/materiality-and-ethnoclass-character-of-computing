# An introduction to social computing
SFPC Detroit
Monday August 19th

## Abstract
This class serves as a whirlwind introduction to the field of computing, from the teacher's perspective as a colonized subject who studied computer science and worked as a software developer for some years, before beginning to develop a more critical consciousness about the power dynamics embedded into technology. It is structured as a lecture,

## Class Agenda
2 hr 30 min total, including 10 min of unallocated "flex time"

### Lecture
40 min
Slides (mostly done but still WIP): https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14MsP5lrQKgWRn87_Yd7P_bVSP_5UaTO9qEGs3ME2YDo/edit#slide=id.g5e2397ce12_0_55

The opening lecture attempts to situate computing in its broad social context by including remarks on:
- a few key facts on the history of computers
- a brief comparison of some popular programming environments
- the racialized and gendered division of labor in the computing industry
- the uneven ecological impacts and materiality of computing, including its relationship to mining, factory labor, and climate change
- liberatory counter-currents to the dominant ideologies in the field

### Lab
1 hr 10 min

TODOs:
- create a worked example for my own notes, for fellow teachers/TAs to become familiar with before class, and to provide as a reference to students after completing the code-along
- develop a list of exercises appropriate to various levels of coding experience
- STRETCH: create a website or program that can sensibly/interestingly display generated texts, that students would ideally create as an output of one or more of the class exercises

Half of the class is allotted for "lab time" in which students can choose from a range of exercises to analyze (and perhaps generate) texts with Python. This section will begin with an optional code-along to introduce the following fundamental concepts to beginners:
- running programs from the command line
- file-based and terminal-based input and output
- using for loops to repeatedly undertake actions, and produce summary values
- using if statements to conditionally execute code
- datatypes, basic and compound: strings, ints, floats, booleans; lists and dictionaries
- understanding and googling error messages or otherwise unexpected results

### Discussion
30 min

Finally, we will come back together to have a concluding discussion. First we will have five minutes of silent reflection and writing, open to whatever students want to capture, with the first guiding question below posed as a jumping-off point.

Tthen our conversation can flow freely with some structure from these guiding questions:
- What was your experience like coding just now? (Let's hear *first*, but not *only*, from folks who doing it for the first time, or just gaining comfort/familiarity)
- What does the lack of a pre-capitalist model of computing to be reclaimed or recovered mean for our imaginary of computing's possible futures?
- How do you personally relate to the uneven ecological impacts and the racialized and gendered division of labor in the global computing? Have you observed similar patterns on a more intimate scale in your own lives and work?
- What liberatory potential have we experienced computers being used for, or can we imagine them being used for?

## Pre-work
Please keep in mind the guiding questions posed by the last paragraph above (except the one about the experience of coding during class time), in conversation with your own backgrounds and interests, and jot down some notes (questions, impressions, summaries, connections, etc.) as you do the reading! And also, please bring at least one text to class that you can learn to use Python to analyze.

### Bring a favorite text (or two, or many!) to class
Save somewhere in your email or notes the URL(s) of a favorite book, short story, poem, letter, essay, or other text that you think it would be interesting to create derivative work based off. It is preferable that this would be in plain text format (as opposed to a PDF or webpage), but if you're unsure what that means or can't find a text you like in that format, don't spend a lot of time worrying about it -- we can fix it before class or in the lab, or you can use one of the texts I will have ready for class.

### Required reading (short!)
- Amiri Baraka, "Technology and Ethos", http://www.marilynnance.com/titanic/baraka.html

### Optional reading/viewing/listening (long, but please start/skim at least one):
- Kate Crawford and Vladen Joler, "Anatomy of an AI System: The Amazon Echo as an anatomical map of human labor, data and planetary resources", https://anatomyof.ai/
- Nabil Hassein, "Computing, climate change, and all our relationships", https://www.deconstructconf.com/2018/nabil-hassein-computing-climate-change-and-all-our-relationships
