### PART 0: up and running. function calls, variables, strings, output.
print("hello, world")  # the traditional first program

person = "nabil"  # this is an "assignment" statement, with one =
                  # the variable named "person" stores the string value "nabil"
print("hello, " + person)  # this is called string concatenation

## exercises:
# Modify the above code to greet a neighbor at your seat.
# Say something kind to them after their name. (There are at least two ways to do this.)
